Senior Capstone Project - Team NaN (Nick Aiello, Anthony Narin, Nick Kirkpatrick)

## Status Update as of 3/27

- Google cloud setup properly and configured to work with uploaded files. Payment set up as well and should be able to complete project using only the free trial. At the moment only fully recorded files are able to be transcribed. It is important that we are able to do streaming transcription and that will be next in our progression. Currently the workflow is as follows. Recorded file --> cloud machine -- > Cloud API --> back to the client

## Status Update as of 4/16

- Google cloud setup to deal with streaming audio. Not tested yet with real conversation. Glass app almost completely done except for integration with the other code.
